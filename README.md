# CapsuleShooter

In this game, you control a red capsule. You need to stay alive by evading the chasing enemy capsules. You need to choose where to go wisely as the game area is full of obstacles. Do not attempt to go beyond the game area because you will fall and instantly die. If you die, the game is over. You gain points by killing enemy capsules. The faster you kill enemies, the more points you gain. If all enemies in a level is killed, you go to the next level where a new obstacle map and more powerful enemy capsules awaits. How long will you survive?
